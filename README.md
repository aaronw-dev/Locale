## What inspired this project?
Citizen reporting apps like <a href="https://citizen.com">Citizen</a> and <a href="https://vancouver.ca/van311.aspx">Van311</a> motivated the creation of a more accessible web-based platform for reporting local issues.
This project was inspired by citizen reporting apps such as Citizen and Van311. We realized that we need to have more democratized access to these sorts of citizen reporting platforms, so we decided to create a web-based interface that would be more accessible to people who, for example, may not be able to install apps from certain app stores onto their devices.

## What does the project accomplish?
It enables citizens to report local issues like <a href="https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2022/01/13/potholes-extreme-weather-bc/">potholes</a> and fire hydrant floods, aiming to improve safety and minimize commute delays. 

## What challenges were faced?
- Designing multiple UIs and having them cohesively work together 
- Firebase user verification
- Final integration

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a functional front-end that matches design concepts.

## What's next for Locate?
Proper deployment and collaboration with moderators and city councils.
