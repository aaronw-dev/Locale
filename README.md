## What inspired this project?
This project was inspired by citizen reporting apps such as <a href="https://citizen.com">Citizen</a> and <a href="https://vancouver.ca/van311.aspx">Van311</a>. We realized that we need to have more democratized access to this sorts of citizen reporting platforms, so we decided to create a web-based interface that would be more accessible to people who, for example, may not be able to install apps from certain app stores onto their devices.

## What does the project accomplish?
This project enables citizens anywhere to report local issues like 
<a href="https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2022/01/13/potholes-extreme-weather-bc/"> 
unpatched potholes</a> and <a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/car-crash-downtown-vancouver-flooded">fire hydrant floods</a>. Our goal is to help people across the world stay safe and minimize delays to commutes, for example.
